Hyemin Lee 20190533 Assignment1

I used vscode of my window computer while coding this, since I  was already using vscode before.
However, I didn't know how to use SSH to connect somewhere. So I googled it to found how and I did it!

After that, now I tried to start coding, but another trouble occur.
The assignment said I have to draw DFA first, before start coding.
So again, I googled about DFA and asked to people who already passed this course.
After understanding, I draw my own DFA and finally, now I was able to start coding.

While coding, I editted my DFA a large amount of times. There was exceptions which I didn't recognized before.
At the end, I re-draw my DFA to be seen more clear than before.

My code is PERFECTLY described as STATES and ARROWS of my DFA.
If you read my DFA before grading, we'll be able to understand by code very easilly. :)

Extra explain for DFA)
States : START, GAP, MAYBE_COMMENT, COMMENT, MAYBE_COMMENT_ENDS, WORD, END, ERROR
Types of arrows : SPACE( ), ENTER(\n), SLASH(/), STAR(*), EOF, CHAR(other characters)
