Hyemin Lee 20190533 Assignment2

1. ABOUT SOMEONE'S HELP
I did Part1 well, but I've got some problem in Part2. "Segmentation Fault" bothered me.
Since I didn't know about gdb, I was very suffering. However, my room mate, SangA Choi had taught me how to use gdb.
By utilizing gdb, I was able to debug the problems and successfully completed my code.

2. DISCUSSION ABOUT StrCopy
NO
Assert function can only determine whether the memory is empty or not.
It can't determine the included value is valuable or not.

3. EXTRA CREDIT
I used ONLY POINTER NOTATION in Part1 to get extra credit :)
