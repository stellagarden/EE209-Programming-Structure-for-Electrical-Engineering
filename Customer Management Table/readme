1. ABOUT HELP
I've received lots of help from our professor's lecture note. The code about hash table helped me a lot.
Execpt that, I haven't received any other helps from any other sources.


2. COMPARE ARRAY AND HASH TABLE
We can think of two cases, when the number of customers are few or lot.

If there's only few customers, implementing with array would be efficient way.
That's because even if we implement with hash table, the number of nodes in each hash index will be 0 or 1 or 2. (Whatever, it would be very small.)
This means that if we implement with hash table in the case we have few customers, this will just use unnecessary memory and take time to calculate hash.
Even though the structure of array and hash table is not that different in this case.

In contrast, if there's lots of customers, implementing with hash function would be much efficient.
Let's assume there are n customers registered.
In case of array, regardless of the number of customers, if we want to search something, we have to go over almost every nodes, n nodes, on average.
However, hash function shows it's ability in this case.
If the size of hash array is m, to search something, we only need to go over n/m nodes, on average.

So there's some pros and cons of implementing with array and hash table.


3. HASH TABLE EXPANSION
Implemented. It's in a function named "ResizeD".
